# Remove GraphQL Generics

**Status: Proposed**

## Context

Our GraphQL portion of the codebase has [limited unit test coverage][1]. The [current implementation][2] follows [DRY programming][7] principles very wellâ€“however the usage of generics to decrease repetition makes the code harder to test and maintain.

The core of the current implementation is the `Query` type, an abstract base class:

The current implementation also relies heavily on Generics for strong typing which can make the code difficult to read and maintain. The design is very similar to the iOS implementation. Generics are used on iOS to conform to a `Codable` interface for JSON parsing. There is no `Codable` equivalent on Android.

## Decision

The Payments SDK has a [layered architecture][3]. It can be thought of as an extension to the [OSI Model][4], adding additional layers within the application layer. Each layer communicates with the layer directly below it:

As seen in the diagram above, the API layer is a self contained component responsible for translating merchant payment requests into HTTP requests. The API layer encapsulates the fine grained details required to communicate with either a RESTful or GraphQL web service. With encapsulation, the caller doesn't need to know how each API is accessed.  The API layer is respsible for making web requests and parsing their results.

We should refactor the GraphQL portion of the code base to be centered around the actual JSON request. We can enforce strong typing within the API layer by returning value objects detailing the parsed API response.

The `GraphQLClient` is a part of the HTTP layers, since GraphQL requests are made over HTTP. GraphQL responses are JSON formatted, and can be parsed in the API layer to extract information from the JSON into a value object that's returned to the client. Clients can inspect the value objects returned by the API layer and forward this information to the merchant app, or they can make additional API calls as needed without having to be concerned with low-level networking details.

We can also have an opportunity to follow a GraphQL best practice of [providing variables via JSON][5]. We can turn each query into an Android raw resource and take advantage of the [IntelliJ GraphQL Plugin][6] for compile time syntax checking and auto completion.

## Consequences

The code will become less DRY, but the task to create a JSONObject GraphQL query isn't overly complex. In this scenario, we may benefit less from DRY code than we do from having readible code that's easy to follow. We do gain flexibility by removing generics, since the API layer will have access to the full `HttpRequest` object.
