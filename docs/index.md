Accept card payments in your app using the PayPal In-App Payments SDK.

## How it works

The In-App payments SDK allows for merchant apps to integrate easily with PayPal payment services on both the client and server.

You need to have a server integration to create an order and capture the funds using [PayPal Orders v2 API](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/orders/v2). The Payments SDK will allow you to approve the order in your client side using the buyer's card information.

Accept card payments using our card fields UI

`Placeholder: Include images of card fields`

**Requirements:**
Card fields UI offers a low effort integration where you can use our card fields UI, and our card fields will handle ...


### Code sample

#### 1. Create an order
Call `v2/checkout/orders` to create an order an obtain an order ID

```
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.sandbox.paypal.com/v2/checkout/orders/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>' \
--data-raw '{
    "intent": "CAPTURE",
    "purchase_units": [
        {
            "amount": {
                "currency_code": "USD",
                "value": "5.00"
            }
        }
    ]
}'
```

#### 2. Approve the order using Payments SDK:

#### iOS
```swift
import PaymentsSDK

// Create an config object using your clientID obtained from PayPal application portal
let config = CoreConfig(clientID: "<CLIENT_ID>", evironment: .sandbox)

// Create a CardClient object to process a card payment
let cardClient = CardClient(config: config)

// Create a card object from buyer's inputs
let card = Card(
    number: "4111111111111111",
    expirationMonth: "01",
    expirationYear: "25",
    securityCode: "123"
)

// Create a CardRequest and approve the order using buyer's card when buyer submit their card info.
let cardRequest = CardRequest(orderID: "<ORDER_ID>", card: card)
cardClient.approveOrder(request: cardRequest) { result in
    switch result {
        case .success(let result):
            // Order is successfully approved with card and ready to be capture/authorize.
        case .failure(let error):
            // Encountered error when approving order.
    }
}
```

#### Android
```kotlin=
// placeholder
```

#### 3. Capture/authorize the order
Call `v2/checkout/orders/<ORDER_ID>/authorize` to place funds on hold:

```
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.sandbox.paypal.com/v2/checkout/orders/<orderID>/authorize' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>' \
--data-raw ''
```

Call `v2/checkout/orders/<ORDER_ID>/capture` to capture funds immediately:

```
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.sandbox.paypal.com/v2/checkout/orders/<orderID>/capture' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>' \
--data-raw ''
```
